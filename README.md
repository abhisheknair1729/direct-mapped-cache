A simple implementation and testbench for a direct mapped cache. The aim of this project was to experiment with development and execution of a test-plan using a design specification. The specification and test-plan can be found in the spec directory. The src directory contains all the verilog code and the testbench used for verifying the code. The sim directory was used to hold simulation artifacts such as waveform files. The repository contains an empty sim directory.

Any comments or feedback is appreciated.

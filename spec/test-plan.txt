Tests will be a sequence of reads and writes. Important scenarios that must be tested are:

1. Cache Line Eviction does not corrupt data
2. Reads do not corrupt data
3. Dirty data will be stored in the main memory before being evicted
4. The mapping of addresses to cache lines is consistent
5. Every read/write request completes in 2,3,4 cycles

Some important coverage metrics are:

1. Every data element in every cache line must be tested (written/read) atleast once
2. Every cache line must be evicted atleast twice (once while clean, once while dirty)
